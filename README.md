## Neovim settings in Lua
This repository contains all of my settings re-written from scratch in Lua.

I am constantly hopping text editors between Vim-Nvim-Helix-VsCode.

Until the next time.

### Nvim folder
`~/.config/nvim` contains all the settings and the `init.lua`

I have 4 folders:
* .git (to version the changes)
* lua (where I have all the settings in separate lua files)
* plugin (this is where I put the plugin settings in order to keep `set.lua` clean)
* undodir (self explanatory)
